Using Custom Protoc Plugins

  It is possible to customize <<<protoc>>>'s output with plugins. This is done by
  adding adding a <<<protocPlugins>>> element containing one of more <<<protocPlugin>>> elements
  to the <<<configuration>>> section. Protoc plugins are executables that are invoked by <<<protoc>>>.
  They read code generator requests from <<<stdin>>> and output results to <<<stdout>>>.

  In the current version only plugins written in Java (or any other JVM
  language) and resolvable as Maven artifacts are supported. Also, the output
  directory for generated files is the same as the Java output directory.

  In future versions support for other types of executables will be added as well.

* Using a <<<protoc>>> plugin

  The following example includes uses a single plugin to generate Java code in addition
  to <<<protoc>>>'s regular output.

+-----+

<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <extensions>true</extensions>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>myproto</groupId>
      <artifactId>myproto-protoc-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
          <goal>compile</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <protocPlugins>
          <protocPlugin>
            <id>myproto</id>
            <mainClass>myproto.MyProtocPlugin</mainClass>
          </protocPlugin>
        </protocPlugins>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>

+-----+

  This will resolve the Maven artifact <<<myproto:myproto-protoc-plugin:1.2>>> and its dependencies, create
  a plugin executable on the fly and then invoke <<<protoc>>> with the argument <<<--myproto_out=JAVAOUT>>>
  where <<<JAVAOUT>>> is same directory used for the <<<--java_out>>> argument.

* <<<protocPlugin>>> Options

  The following options can be  included in the <<<protocPlugin>>> element:

  * <<<id>>> - (required) unique id for this plugin

  * <<<mainClass>>> - (required) Java main class to execute

  * <<<javaHome>>> - (optional) location of the JDK used for executing the plugin;
    uses the JDK specified in <<<toolchains.xml>>> or the value of the <<<java.home>>> system property as default

  * <<<winJvmDataModel>>> - (optional; Windows only) data model of the JVM under <<<javaHome>>>. Possible values
    are '32' or '64'.

  * <<<args>>> - (optional) argument to pass to the <<<main>>> method

  * <<<jvmArgs>>> - (optional) JVM arguments

  The location of the <<<java>>> command (on UNIX) or <<<jvm.dll>>> on Windows is determined as follows. First, the
  <<<javaHome>>> option in <<<protocPlugin>>> is used, if present. Otherwise, the <<<jdkHome>>> location of the
  <<<jdk>>> toolchain in <<<toolchains.xml>>> is used. If no toolchain has been set up, the JDK that's running
  Maven is used (the value of the <<<java.home>>> system property).

  When running on Windows the plugin will try to determine whether <<<javaHome>>> is pointing to a 32-bit or
  64-bit JDK/JRE. If it cannot determine the data model from directories under <<<javaHome>>> it will use the
  value of the <<<sun.arch.data.model>>> system property in the JVM that is running the plugin code. If that
  system property does not exist it will default to 32-bit. The value can be overridden by setting the
  <<<winJvmDataModel>>> option.


* Java plugin generation

  An Java-based executable is assembled on the fly from the specified artifact and its dependencies and executed by
  <<<protoc>>>. The way this is done is platform-dependent.

  On UNIX, a shell script is created in <<<target/protoc-plugins>>> that builds a classpath from local repository
  paths of all resolved artifacts and then runs the configured <<<java>>> command.

  On Windows, a WinRun4J executable (bundled inside the Maven plugin jar) is copied into <<<target/protoc-plugins>>>
  and an <<<.ini>>> is generated with the required classpath, <<<jvm.dll>>> location, main class and arguments.
  Please note that at the moment only 32-bit JVMs are supported on Windows.

  The <<<target/protoc-plugins>>> directory is prepended to the <<<PATH>>> in <<<protoc>>>'s runtime environment.
